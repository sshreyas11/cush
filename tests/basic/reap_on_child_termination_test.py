# reap_on_child_termination_test: 
# Tests that a background process will be reaped when it finishes
# even when the shell is waiting for user input with readline. 
# This requires the SIGCHLD to not be blocked when waiting on user input
# We want to have this behaviour so that the process resources are not tied up unnecessarily.
# 
#
#
# 
# Requires the following commands to be implemented
# or otherwise usable:
#
#	sleep
#
# In addition the shell must be capable of running processes in the background.
# This includes giving the proper output when running a command in the background
# this is of the form:
#
# [jobid] pid
#

# If it takes more than 2 seconds to give the prompt back to the user after typing in sleep 2 & then 
# the shell should be deemed much too slow anyways and will fail the test
# we do not expect 2 seconds to be a time student shells will come close to at all.
